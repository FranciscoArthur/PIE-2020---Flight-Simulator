### Considered plane
plane = ['c172']       

### Initial conditions : position, speed, orientation, angular speed, payload, fuelload

### Plane coordinates - in ground frame
# Position = [North_position, East_position, Altitude]
# Orientation = [Yaw angle, Roll angle, Pitch angle]
# Speed = [Velocity at x-axis, Velocity at y-axis, Velocity at z-axis ]
# Angular_Speed = [Yaw rate, Roll rate, Pitch rate]

initial_position = [0, 0, 100]     # [m]
initial_orientation = [0, 0, 0]
initial_speed = [50, 0, 0]        # [m/s]
initial_angular_speed = [0, 0, 0]

# Plane loading 
payload = 100                     # [kg]
initial_fuel_load = 100           # [kg]


### Weather conditions
# Wind expected to remain constant - represented by the wind ground speed vector
wind = [0, 0, 0]         
weather = [wind]                   # Next : add humidity/rain ?

### Integration parameters
time_of_study = 1
delta_t = 0.1
number_of_time_steps = int(time_of_study/delta_t) + 1    # DO NOT MODIFY

### Pilot commands, time-dependant
