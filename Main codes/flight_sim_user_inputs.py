Description :
The following script provides to the simulator user the interface where is 
selected the different simulation inputs.
Actually the simulator is a time-resolved code where the time-dependant 
parameters are selected by the user before the simulation, compared to a 
live simulator.

### Considered plane
plane = ['c172']                    # 'c172' = Cessna172 - 'b747' = Boeing747       



### Initial conditions : position, speed, orientation, angular speed, payload, fuel load

### Initial plane coordinates - in ground frame
# Position = [North_position, East_position, Altitude]
# Orientation = [Yaw angle, Roll angle, Pitch angle]
# Speed = [Velocity at x-axis, Velocity at y-axis, Velocity at z-axis]
# Angular_Speed = [Yaw rate, Roll rate, Pitch rate]

initial_position = [0, 0, 1800]     # [m]

initial_speed = [70.3, 0, 0]          # [m/s]

# Plane loading 
payload = 100                       # [kg]

### Weather conditions
wind = [0, 0, 0]                    # Constant wind vector - ground frame [m/s]
weather = [wind]                    # Next : add humidity/rain ?


### Integration parameters
time_of_study = 10                # [s]
delta_t = 0.01                      # [s]

### Pilot commands, time-dependant - each command is a list of number_of_time_steps elements

# Elevators commands - time-dependant - relative value from -10 to 10 
command_elevators_position = np.array([0. for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])  
# for i in range (int(number_of_time_steps/100)):
#     command_elevators_position[100*i] = 1.

command_rudder_position = np.array([0. for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])
# for i in range (10):
#     command_rudder_position[100000 + i] = 1.
# command_rudder_position[10000] = 1.

# Ailerons commands - time-dependant - relative value from -10 to 10
command_ailerons_position = np.array([0. for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])  
# command_ailerons_position[10] = 1
# command_ailerons_position[11] = -1
# command_ailerons_position[12] = -1

# Throttle commands - time-dependant - relative value from 0 to 10
command_throttle_position = np.array([8. for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])  

# Other commands - time-dependant - 0 or 1 (1 means activated)
command_air_brakes = np.array([0 for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])        
command_hygh_lift_devices = np.array([0 for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])  
command_landing_gear = np.array([0 for i in range(number_of_time_steps)])      



### Automatic pilot order - optional
# Define a targeted altitude or leave 'False' for uncontrolled flight
# If a targeted altitude is defined, it must be equal to the initial altitude defined above : initial_position[2]

Target_altitude = False
# Target_altitude = initial_position[2]







###############################################################################
# DO NOT MODIFY WHAT IS BELOW

# Positive to minus altitude - the code works with a vertical axis positive towards the ground
initial_position[2]*=-1             

### Gathering the user's inputs

initial_conditions.append(initial_angular_speed)

pilot_inputs = [command_throttle_position, command_rudder_position, command_ailerons_position, command_elevators_position, command_air_brakes, command_hygh_lift_devices, command_landing_gear]

### Call the main function Flight_Simulator_fct in order to compute the results and display them
result = Flight_Simulator_fct(plane, initial_conditions, weather, integration_parameters, pilot_inputs, Target_altitude)
