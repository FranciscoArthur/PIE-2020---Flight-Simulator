### Considered plane
plane = ['c172']       

### Initial conditions : position, speed, orientation, angular speed, payload, fuelload

### Plane coordinates - in ground frame
# Position = [North_position, East_position, Altitude]
# Orientation = [Yaw angle, Roll angle, Pitch angle]
# Speed = [Velocity at x-axis, Velocity at y-axis, Velocity at z-axis]
# Angular_Speed = [Yaw rate, Roll rate, Pitch rate]

# Plane loading

### Weather conditions
# Wind expected to remain constant - represented by the wind ground speed vector
